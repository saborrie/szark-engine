# Description
This is a game engine entirely in C# made for easy and accessible 2D graphics. 
This is one of my projects that I have used to learn more about C# and programming and has evolved to something on its own. 
The engine is in developement but it is functional and documented. 
It uses the OpenTK library for windowing and OpenGL, and OpenAL for the audio. Documentation is currently sparse and out of date so looking at the source code would be prefferable. 

Feel free to branch and fix or add things of your own.

Requests are also welcome!

# Getting Started

2. Get Latest Release Version
3. Add Reference to that .dll in your project
